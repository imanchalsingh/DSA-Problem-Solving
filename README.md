# DSA Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my **DSA Problem Solving** repository. Here, I have documented and solved a variety of problems from different platforms to strengthen my problem-solving and programming skills.

## Platforms Covered
- **LeetCode**  
- **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**
- **Project Euler (Algorithms) 'Basic'**

## Languages Used
- **JavaScript:** Some problems were initially solved in JavaScript.  
- **C++:** Certain problems were later converted to C++ to practice more fundamental implementations without relying on JavaScriptâ€™s built-in functions. 

## Notes
- The main goal of this repository is to reinforce core DSA concepts and improve algorithmic thinking.  
- Problems are organized by topic and platform for easier reference.  
- Solutions include both initial JavaScript implementations and optimized C++ versions where applicable.

## Future Work
- Add more advanced DSA problems.  

This repository is a personal journey in DSA practice and problem-solving. Any suggestions for improvement or feedback are welcome!
